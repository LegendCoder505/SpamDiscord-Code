🚀 Introducing Spam Code (SC) – A Powerful Discord Messaging Tool!

I’ve built a Spam Code (SC) that can flood messages, making even your most annoying friends rethink their actions! But remember—this tool is for fun and educational purposes only. Spamming can violate Discord’s Terms of Service, so use it responsibly and avoid disrupting communities.

⚠️ Disclaimer: This script is meant for testing and educational purposes. Misusing it may result in account bans. Use with caution and respect others' boundaries.
